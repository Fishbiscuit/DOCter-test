Adopting the model of a Conference with large-scale talks targeted at the general audience but also breakout sessions that participants can sign-up for on an individualised manner.

**Emphasis on personal agency to allow for self-discovery of SUTD's ecosystem.**

## Objectives
1. For Freshmores - understand the spaces (virtual and physical), avenues for resources and communities in SUTD in order to embody the desired culture
Culture embodying the spirit of innovation, collaboration, having self-initiated projects, self-directed learning and broad-based skill integration

2. For SUTD - celebrate the work done by our research community, 5th rows and housing (specifically amongst seniors)
Showcase the potential of UROPs and taking up research projects in SUTD, similar to LCC in an interactive/ experiential manner
