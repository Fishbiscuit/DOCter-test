# What is this?
Discovery Week is a 3 week long introduction to the SUTD community. It will last from 22nd May - 7 June 2019.
The event is hosted on [Eventyay](https://eventyay.com/e/80f9d561/), powered by an Open Source Event server.

It is currently a [working title](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_title) because the name is still in the midst of being decided. Afterall, it's a 3 week event and no longer just one week!

Discovery Week is organised by the team behind [OpenSUTD](https://github.com/OpenSUTD).

OpenSUTD is modelled after the idea of an Open Organisation, and we have community standards for all members to abide by in order to ensure a good enviroment for members to learn and contribute effectively.
```
An Open Organization is one that engages participative communities both inside and out; responds to opportunities more quickly, has access to resources and talent outside the organization, and inspires, motivates, and empowers people at all levels to act. -Open Organisation Definition
```

This is why we are making sure that our project documents are kept open so that **you** can be a part of this process.
